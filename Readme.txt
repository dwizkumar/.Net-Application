Project-3: As a part of implementation mostly I have user forms to display the content on click of button.
I found that code is taking bit of time to load. However, its works as expected.

Special features: 
1. Used regular expression to remove html tags from copyrights on footer page.
2. Hiding and displaying new buttons for academic advisors, professional advisors,faculty advisors, and IST Minor advising if advising is clicked. 
3. Used two levels of form for the popups to display content of Minors and courses.
4. I am disabling button to load co-op table and enrollment table once it is clicked and data is populated to avoid unnecessary load.
5. I am loading each and every bit of code dynamically.
6. Implemented task spinner for people but somehow the gif image that I am loading for spinner is not spining while loading the images.
